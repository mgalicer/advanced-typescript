Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js (v8.x+) installed (we recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to update to a recent version)

Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a TypeScript Intellisense plugin for your favorite text editor.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/VICEMedia/advanced-typescript
$ cd intro-to-typescript/exercise
$ npm install
```

# This lesson will cover

* generics
* defining React props & states using interfaces
* extending interfaces
* making a React app using TypeScript & TSX

---

# Generics

Generics are components that can work over a variety of types instead of just one.

---

<CodeSurfer
  title='Props & State interfaces'
  code={ require('!raw-loader!./snippets/generics-example.tsx') }
  lang='typescript'
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [1, 10], notes: 'interfaces for props and state' },
    { lines: [11], notes: 'React.Component is generically typed' },
  ]}
/>

---

# Extends keyword

Much like classes can extend other classes in JavaScript, interfaces can extend other interfaces.

Extending interfaces can help keep type definitions DRY, and make components more reuseable.

---

<CodeSurfer
  title='Extending a class'
  code={ require('!raw-loader!./snippets/class-extends-example.ts') }
  lang='typescript'
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [1, 3], notes: 'MyBloodsucker is a class with just one field' },
    { range: [4, 9], notes: 'MyVampire is its own class, but also extends MyBloodsucker' },
    { range: [11, 12], notes: 'as a result, MyVampire has inherited the pintsConsumed field' },
  ]}
/>

<CodeSurfer
  title='Extending an interface'
  code={ require('!raw-loader!./snippets/extends-example.ts') }
  lang='typescript'
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [1, 4], notes: 'MyMonsterBase is an interface for all monster-related components to use' },
    { range: [6, 10], notes: 'Anything implementing MyMonster must also include all attributes from MyMonsterBase' },
    { range: [12, 16], notes: 'MyZombie will now need to have all attributes from MyMonster and MyMonsterBase' },
  ]}
/>

# Monster maker using React

* Write an interface for all monsters
* Write classes for your favorite monsters that implement the Monster class
* Create a component that can display all monsters
* Give the monsters the ability to feed with specific text for each class
